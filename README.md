iGEM Tel Aviv University Israel 2019 - TailOR-Swift software

For using the software (No python required) -
* Windows users - just download the Tail-OR-Swift.msi file from Windows directory and install.
* Mac users - 
  (1) Downlaod "TailOR_Swift.zip" from Mac OS directory
  (2) Extract zip file
  (3) Run "Run-Tail OR_Swift" 
  
IMPORTANT - Do not download the entire project folder at once - in order to get the mac / windows run files you need to enter the folder and download the file specifically (due to the fact that it is stored on an LFS server)

For a look behind the scenes on the files and algorithms, you can take a look on the files in "under the hood" folder
